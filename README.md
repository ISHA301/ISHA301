## 👩‍💼 About Me  
I turn business questions into data-backed decisions.

Currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at East Texas A&M University, I specialize in:

✅ Understanding business requirements  
✅ Transforming raw data through analysis & modeling  
✅ Building BI dashboards & automated reporting  
✅ Presenting insights that drive business outcomes  

I believe analytics is not about charts — it's about **clarity, decisions, and measurable impact**.
